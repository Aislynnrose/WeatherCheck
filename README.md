# **Weather Dashboard**

This website was built using [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/)

## What's my purpose?
```
*When a user visits the weather forecaster website

*They can type a city into the searchbar

*Then they will view the city data with the next five days weather

*The UV index will be green for good, yellow for okay and red for bad
```
